This project is called Profile-Comparer. As the name suggests, the scripts involved compare multiple user’s 
Instagram profiles i.e. the number of Posts they have, the number of followers they have and the number of people 
they’re following. It uses NodeJS along with the Cheerio and Puppeteer modules, for data extraction and browser 
automation respectively.

The program runs as follows: 
Step 1: Open a browser Window and redirect to www.Instagram.com
Step 2: Log in to Instagram using credentials provided in a separate file
Step 3: Search the profiles using the usernames (also present in aforementioned file).
Step 4: Use Cheerio to extract desired data.
Step 5: Search for the next profile.
Step 6: Repeat steps 3 to 5 until all profiles have been searched and all data has been extracted.
Step 7: Close the Browser Window.
Step 8: Display all extracted Data in a Tabular format in the Node window.
